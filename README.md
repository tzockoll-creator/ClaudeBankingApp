## Data Source

This app uses synthetic banking data generated by MicroStrategy's Banking Branch Performance Agent via the MCP `ask_agent` tool. The dataset contains no real customer data, personal information, or credentials.

The "Refresh Data" button in the sidebar re-parses the bundled dataset. For production use, this can be wired to live MCP agent queries.
